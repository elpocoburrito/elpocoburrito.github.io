# Dakota’s Beginner Guide to IPTV Streaming

Welcome! This guide will help you start watching live TV channels using IPTV apps and services.

> 💡 **Tip:**
>
> This guide would be easiest on a computer.

### Step 1: Choose your IPTV App

For most people, **TiviMate** is the best and easiest app for watching IPTV.

- **TiviMate** works on Google TV and Firestick devices.
- Download from the Google Play Store or Amazon Appstore.
- A one-time purchase of $35 lets you use it on up to 5 devices.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> TiviMate is **not** available for iPhone/iPad, Windows/Mac, Apple TV, or Android phones. For those devices, search for a compatible IPTV player.

### Step 2: Choose your IPTV Provider

There are two types of IPTV providers:

#### 1. Public IPTV Services
- Examples: [Trex](https://www.g2g.com/categories/trex-iptv-accounts) and [Strong8K](https://www.g2g.com/categories/strong-iptv-8k-accounts)
- Can be easily purchased online and have large, broad, channel lists.

#### 2. Private IPTV Services
- Example: [Binge Ninjas](http://discord.gg/jointhedojo) on Discord
- These cost more but offer better quality, faster loading, higher resolution, and customer support.

> **Tip:**
>
> Private services are recommended for the best experience.

### Step 3: Set Up Your EPG (TV Guide)

- **EPG** stands for Electronic Program Guide. It shows what’s playing on each channel.
- **Private services** usually include EPG automatically.
- **Public services** often require you to add your own EPG source.

If you need an EPG, the best source is [MYEPG](https://myepg.top/).

### Step 4: Set Up TiviMate

1. **Install TiviMate** on your device.
2. Open TiviMate and select **Add Playlist**.
3. Choose **Xtream Codes**.
4. Enter the server URL, username, and password from your IPTV provider.
5. If you’re using a public IPTV service, go to **Settings > EPG** and add your EPG source (such as MYEPG). Set it as the default.

> 🎉 **You’re done!**
>
> You can now stream movies and shows on your TV, phone, or computer.
